# AI Playground - Where Creativity meets Learning

AI Playground is a web application built with React that allows users to engage in fun and interactive drawing activities. Users receive drawing prompts from an AI, draw the prompted object, and get their drawings evaluated for accuracy. The app provides various tools to assist users in creating their artwork.

## Core Gameplay & Features

1. **Creative Quest:**: Gemini generates drawing prompts, and users compete to create the most accurate and imaginative artwork.
2. **Artful Guess**: Users draw freely, and Gemini attempts to identify the drawing, providing a unique interactive learning experience.
